# TinyML-Registration-Reader

## Project Description

Final Year Project.
TinyML is a sub-field of Machine Learning where inference is performed on low power microcontroller based embedded systems.
This project is to develop a product which can detect, read and transmit information from car registration plates using low power, low cost hardware.
The project will include the selection of hardware and ML model as well as the development of a prototype and the analysis of the performance of the prototype against a range of benchmarks.

## Object-detection-Testing

Experimenting with object detection and taking input from various sources. Using Python, OpenCV and YoloV4-Tiny. Testing reading from a webcam,and video file. Testing on Apple M1 chip and Raspberry Pi 4.

## Registration-Reader

Testing performance of varations of ANPR(Automatic Number Plate Recognition). Models trained in Google Colab using Yolov5 and Pytorch. Sucessfully trained models to detect and read registration plates. Testing multiple model types on multiple input videos. Inference speed testing on Apple M1 chip and Raspberry Pi 4.
