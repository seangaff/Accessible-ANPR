# TinyML-Registration-Reader

Project Description:

Final Year Project.
TinyML is a sub-field of Machine Learning where inference is performed on low power microcontroller based embedded systems.
This project is to develop a product which can detect, read and transmit information from car registration plates using low power, low cost hardware.
The project will include the selection of hardware and ML model as well as the development of a prototype and the analysis of the performance of the prototype against a range of benchmarks.

## Object-detection-Testing
Experimenting with object detection of cars and comparing Tensorflow and TFlite
